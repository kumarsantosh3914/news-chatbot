# News Chatbot with RAG and Real-time Communication

## Overview
This project implements an intelligent news chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for providing contextually relevant responses to user queries about news articles. The system combines real-time communication through WebSockets with efficient data retrieval and caching mechanisms.

## Architecture

### 1. Embeddings and Vector Storage
The system uses a sophisticated approach to handle document embeddings and vector storage:

#### Embedding Creation
- Documents are processed through a text preprocessing pipeline that includes:
  - Text cleaning and normalization
  - Chunking into manageable segments
  - Embedding generation using state-of-the-art language models
- Each document chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector representation
- Metadata is preserved alongside embeddings for context retrieval

#### Indexing and Storage
- Vector embeddings are stored in a specialized vector database
- The system implements efficient indexing mechanisms for:
  - Fast similarity search
  - Semantic matching
  - Context retrieval
- Index optimization techniques are employed to balance search speed and accuracy

### 2. Redis Caching & Session Management

#### Caching Strategy
- Multi-level caching implementation:
  - L1: In-memory cache for frequently accessed data
  - L2: Redis cache for distributed session management
- Cache invalidation policies ensure data freshness
- TTL (Time-To-Live) mechanisms prevent stale data

#### Session History
- Real-time session tracking using Redis
- Features include:
  - Conversation context preservation
  - User interaction history
  - State management across requests
- Session data structure:
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "unique_identifier",
    "conversation_history": [],
    "user_preferences": {},
    "last_interaction": "timestamp"
  }
  ```

### 3. Frontend-Backend Communication

#### API Integration
- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - User authentication
  - News article retrieval
  - Chat history management
- WebSocket implementation for:
  - Real-time chat updates
  - Streaming responses
  - Connection state management

#### Frontend Implementation
- React-based user interface with:
  - Real-time chat interface
  - News article display
  - User authentication
- State management using Redux/Context API
- WebSocket connection handling:
  ```javascript
  const socket = new WebSocket('ws://api/news-chatbot/ws');
  socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    // Handle incoming messages
  };
  ```

### 4. Design Decisions and Improvements

#### Current Design Decisions
1. **Vector Storage**
   - Chosen for efficient similarity search
   - Enables semantic understanding of queries
   - Scalable for large document collections

2. **Redis Implementation**
   - Selected for distributed caching
   - Provides pub/sub capabilities
   - Ensures session persistence

3. **WebSocket Architecture**
   - Enables real-time communication
   - Reduces latency
   - Supports streaming responses

#### Potential Improvements
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement batch processing for embeddings
   - Add caching layer for frequently accessed vectors
   - Optimize vector search algorithms

2. **Scalability Enhancements**
   - Add horizontal scaling support
   - Implement load balancing
   - Enhance distributed caching

3. **Feature Additions**
   - Add support for multiple languages
   - Implement advanced analytics
   - Add user feedback mechanisms

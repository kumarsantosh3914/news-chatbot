## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the News Chatbot system, detailing the end-to-end flow from user query to response. It covers how embeddings are created and managed, how Redis is used for caching and session history, how the frontend communicates with the backend, and highlights key design decisions and potential improvements.

---

## 1. Embeddings: Creation, Indexing, and Storage

- **Text Data Ingestion:** Raw news articles or documents are ingested into the system.
- **Embedding Generation:** Each text chunk is processed by a language model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace) to generate high-dimensional vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.
- **Indexing:** Embeddings are indexed in a vector database (such as FAISS, Pinecone, or similar) to enable fast similarity search. This allows the system to quickly retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.
- **Storage:** Both the embeddings and associated metadata (e.g., article title, source, timestamp) are stored for efficient retrieval and context-aware responses.

## 2. Redis Caching & Session History

- **Query Caching:** Redis is used to cache frequent queries and their results, significantly reducing response latency for repeated or similar questions.
- **Session History:** Each user session is tracked in Redis, storing the conversation history. This enables the chatbot to provide context-aware answers, maintain continuity, and personalize interactions.
- **Cache Invalidation:** When underlying data changes (e.g., new articles ingested), relevant cache entries are invalidated to ensure up-to-date responses.

## 3. Frontend: API/Socket Calls & Response Handling

- **User Query Submission:** The frontend provides a chat interface where users can type queries.
- **API/WebSocket Communication:** User queries are sent to the backend via REST API calls or WebSocket messages, depending on the implementation.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The frontend listens for responses and updates the chat interface in real-time, ensuring a smooth conversational experience.
- **Session Management:** The frontend manages session tokens or identifiers, allowing users to continue conversations seamlessly across sessions.

## 4. Design Decisions & Potential Improvements

- **Semantic Search:** Using embeddings enables the system to understand user intent and retrieve semantically relevant answers, not just keyword matches.
- **Redis for Speed:** Leveraging Redis for both caching and session management ensures low-latency responses and scalable session tracking.
- **Frontend UX:** Real-time updates and session continuity enhance user experience.

### Potential Improvements
- **Improved Ranking:** Implement advanced ranking algorithms to further refine the relevance of retrieved answers.
- **User Personalization:** Personalize responses based on user preferences, history, or feedback.
- **Expanded Data Sources:** Integrate more diverse and real-time news sources for broader coverage.
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Add features like rich media support, notifications, and accessibility improvements.
